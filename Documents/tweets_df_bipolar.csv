e thing abt my writing is theres always gna be heavy angst &amp; overuse of pet names
rumpyflowerpot ur display name lmaoo
is is why i cant stand true crime youtubers they dehumanize people for content johnnys over here clearly exhausted having to constantly face his abuser publicly n this bitch is like oh noooo my entertainment
ybe its not attractive to you but that doesnt give u the right to speak for everyone ??? like imagine spending all this time working on ur body &amp; being proud of it only for some bitch on twitter dot com to say ur not attractive bc ur not cuddly enough
so can we just..stop with the unnecessary body type opinions just cuz theyre men doesnt make it ok like ?? all bodies r good bodies male anatomy is still pretty even if theyre muscular stop being weird
ing a very clearly photoshopped pic of jimin as an example of male bodies that women actually faun over is insane
s: is invited by the potus to simply give a speech on anti-asian hate during aapi month in a country they dont live in crusty old white men: why arent they fixing all the problems in my country?!!;!!(!4! useless!!1!1!1!!1!1!!

"urse evaluations are a touchy subject, but i'm proud of this one (scored on a point scale)."
"at's why i tweet openly about things i struggle with. i want to normalize being a hot mess sometimes and needing support and help to get through things. (in case anyone thinks otherwise, i'm a hot mess most of the time, and things still turned out mostly okay for m"
"there's one thing i wish i knew earlier in my career, it would be that no one has all of their shit together, it's okay to not be perfect at everything, and that you can be successful even if you're struggling at certain thing"
"m also fortunate and appreciative that i have people at work who know about my disorder. this has been true for longer than i've been publicly tweeting about it, but just having my close colleagues understand that i'm going through an episode helps me get through some days"
"i'm entering a mixed episode, i usually try to clear commitments that stress me out from my calendar because i won't be able to handle any extra anxiety. i also make sure that those close to me know how i'm feeling and what's coming, because they can help support me"
"i can see an episode coming, i can better prepare for what i'll need during that time. if i'm getting depressed, this is a good time for me to stock my fridge, cook some food, and make regular plans with friends to keep me social and grounded."
"'s also really helpful for me to look out for some of the tell-tale signs that a hypomanic, depressive, or mixed episode is coming. usually the first sign of hypomania for me is that i start taking on too many projects or start dreaming up a million vacations to take."
"e biggest thing i do is make time to sleep. i'm a terrible sleeper, so for me this means (doctor-approved) sleep-aids, but also avoiding early morning commitments so that i can get enough hours in because getting a good night's rest is the most protective things i can do"
"last thread for is about things i try to do to help set myself up for success. unfortunately, there's no cure for bipolar disorder, so it's something that i've had to learn to live with and continue to learn to handle every day."
"fers that did help included coming over to help me with chores when my depression flares up, spending time with me when i get anxious and agitated, and helping me sift through all my spiraling thoughts when i'm hypomanic"
"e thing that definitely didn't help was when people would tell me ""call at anytime"" or any other big promise i knew they either couldn't keep or wasn't reasonable to ask them to keep. if you're going to offer support, know your limits as to what you can (and should) offer"
"th then and now, it is always helpful to be reminded that whatever type of episode i'm in will eventually end, that i have gotten myself through it before, and that i'm not going to feel this way all the time."
at was helpful was connecting me to therapists and prescribers once i expressed i was ready for that. so much feels out of control when bipolar disorder flares up that i think it's good to offer help that keeps the power in the persons hands as much as is safely possible
"matter how much you think someone can benefit from therapy or medication, pressuring them into it usually only has a negative effect (unless someone is at a safety risk, then that's a whole other issue). these are things you have to be ready for before you start them."
"rly on, i think what was most helpful was being connected to resources, including peer support and help seeking out the types of treatment i wanted. i connected with a great group of others with bipolar disorder, which helped me gain perspective on what i was going through"
i wanted to talk about ways in which i like to receive support and things that don't help. note that this is just what has and hasn't worked for me over the years. /
"why do i talk about this on the internet where my colleagues and/or students will see? i do this not despite the fact that you'll all see this, i do it because i hope you will. i hope that i can normalize what life is like with this diagnosis, and what life can be."
"e hardest part of receiving my diagnosis was that all i knew about bipolar disorder was what i saw in the media. often characterized as ""crazy"" or ""out of control,"" i didn't want to be those things. over the past few years i've met so many amazing people with this diagnosis"
"was diagnosed in late /early when a primary care doctor prescribed me an ssri for depression, which pushed me into a more classic presentation of hypomania. i convinced myself it wasn't true, resisted medication for a few months, until finally i made peace with it."
"mixed episode, for me, is when the symptoms of hypomania occur while i'm also depressed. this is a particularly hard state for me because i'm on edge and feel out of control from my hypomania while also feeling sadness, guilt, and the whole other slew of depressive thoughts"
"ther than experience high levels of energy, extreme happiness, or invincibility, my hypomania is mostly characterized by interrupted sleep, obsessive/racing thoughts, agitation, irritability, and anxiety. for a long time i just thought i was a stressed out jerk, not bipolar."
"bipolar disorder manifests in three states: depressive episodes, hypomanic episodes, or most commonly, for me, mixed episodes. it took me a long time to realize and to get diagnosed as bipolar because my hypomania and mixed episodes rarely look like what people think"
"day is so i'm going to be posting a few threads throughout the day about my experiences as someone with bipolar (type ) disorder. if you have any questions, i'll be happy to answer them."

"ntal illness isn't sexy. it's a part of me that will never go away, and something i try to be open about, but the times when it's really active is the time it's hardest to be honest. saying ""reach out if you need anything"" doesn't work because in this state, i can't."
's easy to say you'll support someone who has depression until we reach the point that we can't get out of bed for days. it's easy to say you'll support someone with anxiety until it's daily panic attacks. so i've been afraid that talking about it will mean losing support.
"ve been feeling the need to stay quiet about the fact that i'm not doing well, even though i often say that i think we should be able to honest about all sides of our mental health. but it comes with the territory; i have chronic mental illnesses that are flaring up."

"you're struggling with bipolar disorder, or supporting someone in your life who has it, i'm happy to help you connect with resources, and as always, my dms are open. i'm always happy to chat."
"t i hope that by bringing awareness to bipolar disorder and being open about my experiences, i can help break down the stigma associated with it. but mostly i'm telling you all of this because i want you to know who i am. i want you to know my full self and i am bipolar."
"ve chosen to be quite public about my illness, but even still, i'm scared that people will find out. i'm scared to be characterized as crazy, or to have people exclude me from opportunities because they think i'll be unstable. posts like these terrify me to write."
"en things are hard or even when good things happen, i can get sucked into manic or depressive states where i'm no longer in control or able to manage my own emotions. medication and therapy help with this, but often my illness wins and i get dragged into an episode."
"ile everyone experiences mood swings, it's the magnitude, frequency, and amount that it disrupts my daily life that makes this an illness. i hear people joke that they're ""so bipolar"" when they have mood swings, but it's no joke. trust me, you don't want to be bipolar."
until am several nights in a row? i'm probably manic. unable to get out of bed or get anything done? my depression is acting up. ruminating about the smallest things? i'm stuck in an obsessive spiral. worrying about the tiniest things? i'm having an anxiety attack.
"have learned to live with and manage my illness. i live a full life despite my diagnosis, but it is a fundamental component of who i am that i cannot erase or escape from. it will forever be a part of me."
's . i'd like to think bipolar disorder doesn't define me - i am a person outside my diagnosis - but the reality is that bipolar disorder is with me wherever i go and whatever i do. i can't separate myself from the illness. it is simply part of who i am.
