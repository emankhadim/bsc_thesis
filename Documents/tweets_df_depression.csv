really do want to be able to start my novel after i finish (which feels lifetimes away given they're only in the th grade rn) and my brain can't do two stories at once. thats my life atm. i have nobody to talk to so i'm just tossing this into the twitter voi
just have to make peace with the fact that my writing has greatly improved and hopefully new readers will look passed those first few chapters before i found a good format.
d now im fighting the overwhelming urge to go back and tidy up previous chapters in but that is a project i just can't even start because i'll never finish anything by going back and editing over chapter
ankfully i woke up and it was up again so i could finish what i was doing. also went and updated it on ao3 as wel
boy i was ready to punch ffn in the face yesterday. i spent hours going through and re-editing as a fun little re-vamp and right as i was about to do the last chapters (cuz i'm not messing with the outtakes) the website crashes on me.
