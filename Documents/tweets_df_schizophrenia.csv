taylor_tj here's something for you to watch since it disproves you glorifying the nation above christ.
"taylor_tj no, treating sojourners well is a principle of the bible, not nationalism. there is no ""glory"" for a nation. the only ""glory"" there is is for christ. your priorities are backward. you cannot elevate your particular nation to the level of your faith. if you do your faith fall"
taylor_tj not sure how that shows christain nationalism is the right way to think about our faith. the bible speaks a lot about treating sojourners well. the same would apply if the israelites were in exile. there's not an argument for christain nationalism in the bible besides zionis

oshtheschizo i'm afraid what this person says is not convincing to me. it seems he takes one word (sanctify) and uses that as a way to be used the same way every time with different applications. anyone who has spent a good deal o time in lexicons knows this is not the way to do thing

ygarte i think the right way to talk about god if you don't want to use analogies is the phrase: ehyeh-ahser-ehyeh or something similar.

oshtheschizo that is extremely arrogan
oshtheschizo sola fide doesn't even hold for you since you can not have faith and be a christia
oshtheschizo talking about initial salvation of repentance and restoring someone to repentance who has once again crucified christ is not two of the same thing. one is talking about initial salvation and one is talking about those who have fallen away. apples and orange
"oshtheschizo what does the text say? don't do mental gymnastics here. here's what it says, ""for it is impossible to restore them again to repentance,"" it is not ambiguous. it does not say, ""man cannot do this, but god can."" that is inserting your own theology. it says it is impossibl"
"oshtheschizo they take a verse that is completely unrelated to confirm their view. we interpret scripture with scripture, but the passages must at least have something to do with the passages they are using. ""all things are possible with god"" does not mean, ""god can grant them repentance"
oshtheschizo it is a really terrible exegesis. it really is. they are reaching so far to maintain their view. they link verses that have nothing to do with this passage to maintain their view. it's honestly disgustin

"oshtheschizo a lot of atheists have been sincere christians at one point. you would have to say either they are still saved, or god has not given them a consequence. neither is defensible from the bible. at least calvinists have an interpretation of hebrews :4-8 that isn't ridiculou"
"oshtheschizo you can't live like the devil and expect to get into heaven. i admit that i fail and am not perfect, but i make an effort to honor the commitment i made to follow christ. free grace literally means you can live however you want with no consequences. i obey because i lov"
