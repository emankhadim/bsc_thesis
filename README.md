Mental health problems are considered as serious health issues all over the world 
because these problems can lead to severe outcomes like suicide, violence, abuse or 
murder. Majority of people with mental health problems are either untreated or 
undiagnosed. People who end up having schizophrenia, depression, bipolar or OCD for more 
than a year might undergo mental disability (Government Digital Service (GDS), 2014). There 
is a need to identify such problems before it gets worse. Fortunately, social media is as a 
platform where people express their feelings and problems openly. Data science can extract 
and analyze these statements to perform verity of functions for people suffering from 
mental health problems.
This dissertation contributes to the psychology field by providing a system which 
depicts the Twitter users who are potentially suffering/ suffered from depression, bipolar 
disorder and schizophrenia in US, UAE and Singapore. Different numbers of tweets are
extracted from twitter using keywords and hashtags in these three countries. Snscraper was 
used to extract tweets from twitter. These tweets are then filtered out to people who 
convey signs of mental health problems only. Data is extracted from four timestamps within 
2019-2022 to find the impact of Covid19 among twitter users. The dissertation includes all 
the methods, tools and techniques used in the project to achieve its aim and objectives
